# Zarathustra

Zarathustra is the world's first distributed and sharded AI, designed to be a completely open inference platform. Rather than persue a monolithic design, a market of highly specialized models which compute model outputs off-chain coordinate to answer user queries to earn economic rewards on-chain.

The internet has allowed seamless communication of information across individuals globally. Cryptocurrency has enabled the coordination of individuals across the internet, as economic incentives, along with digital property rights and governance models, have fostered a new way for communities to organise and develop open source software together.

In the future, the challenge at hand will not be to coordinate people, but complex networks of intelligent agents. As AI obtains increasing autonomy, a greater demand for communication and interaction between intelligent agents will emerge. These agents will need to be equipped with standardized protocols and interfaces to facilitate trustless data exchange and negotiation. In order to facilitate this coordination effectively, clear economic incentive structures, with rewards and penalties, will need to be defined to ensure strong coordination amongst agents. This is the core vision of Zarathustra.
